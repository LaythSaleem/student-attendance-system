# Teacher Dashboard - Photo-Based Attendance System

## Overview
The Teacher Dashboard provides comprehensive functionality for teachers to manage their classes, mark attendance using photo capture, view analytics, and generate reports. The key feature is the **photo-based attendance system** where students are marked present only if their photo is captured.
