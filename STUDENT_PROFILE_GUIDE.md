// Fetch student profile data
const response = await fetch(`/api/students/${studentId}/profile`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const profileData = await response.json();
```

#### Error Handling
- **404 Error**: Student not found
- **401 Error**: Authentication required
- **500 Error**: Server error (check logs)

## Data Management

### Attendance Calculation
```sql
-- Overall attendance percentage
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_days,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'present' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as present_days,
  ROUND(
    (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'present' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 
    2
  ) as attendance_percentage
FROM attendance 
WHERE student_id = ?;
```

### Monthly Trends
```sql
-- Monthly attendance breakdown
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y-%m', date) as month,
  COUNT(*) as total_days,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'present' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as present_days,
  ROUND(
    (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'present' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 
    2
  ) as attendance_percentage
FROM attendance 
WHERE student_id = ?
GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%m', date)
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load data when profile is accessed
- **Caching**: Cache student data for repeated access
- **Pagination**: Limit attendance history for large datasets

### Database Optimization

- **Efficient Joins**: Minimal database calls with strategic joins
- **Query Limits**: Reasonable limits on data fetching

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Authentication Required**: JWT token validation
- **Role-based Access**: Admin and teacher access to all profiles
- **Student Privacy**: Secure handling of personal information
