## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Individual Class 404 Errors**
- **Problem**: Missing `/api/classes/:id` endpoint
- **Impact**: Frontend couldn't load individual class details
- **Symptom**: HTTP 404 errors when accessing specific classes like `/api/classes/stage_1`

### 2. **Academic Year Fetching Issues**
- **Problem**: Academic year endpoints returned incomplete data structures
- **Impact**: Dropdown components couldn't populate properly
- **Symptom**: Missing `id` and `name` fields in academic year responses

### 3. **Missing Subjects Dropdown**
- **Problem**: `/api/subjects/dropdown` endpoint completely missing
- **Impact**: Topic creation forms couldn't load subject options
- **Symptom**: HTTP 404 error for subjects dropdown

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Added Individual Class Endpoint**
```javascript
// NEW: Individual class endpoint
app.get('/api/classes/:id', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  // Returns detailed class information with topics and student counts
  // Supports all class IDs like 'stage_1', 'graduation', 'stage_2', etc.
  // Includes complete topics array and enrollment statistics
});
```

**Result**: All individual class requests now return complete data with topics, student counts, and teacher information.

### 2. **Enhanced Academic Years Data Structure**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Incomplete data
{ academic_year: "2025-2026" }

// AFTER: Complete data structure
{
  id: "2025-2026",
  academic_year: "2025-2026", 
  name: "2025-2026"
}
```

**Result**: Both `/api/academic-years` and `/api/academic-years/dropdown` now return properly structured data for frontend components.

### 3. **Added Subjects Dropdown Endpoint**
```javascript
// NEW: Subjects dropdown with medical college subjects
app.get('/api/subjects/dropdown', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  // Returns 12 medical subjects including:
  // Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, etc.
});
```

**Result**: Topic creation forms can now load appropriate medical subjects for the college system.
